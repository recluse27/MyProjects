Use 2 ways to realise next fuctions (using frame and using array):
1. Select all households with a total active power consumption greater than 5 kW.
2. Select all households in which the voltage exceeds 235 V.
3. Select all households whose current strength lies within 19-20 And for them to identify those with a washing machine and refrigeration consume more than boiler and air conditioning.
4. Select randomly 500,000 households (without repetition of elements of the sample). Then calculate the average values ??of all 3 groups of electric energy consumption.
5. Select those households that consume more than 18-00 after 6 kW per minute on average, among the selected identify those with basic electricity consumption in the time frame falls on the washing machine, dryer, refrigerator and lighting (Group 2 is the largest) and choose a third result of the first half and one in four result in the second half.
